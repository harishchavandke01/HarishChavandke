        description: "Me and my team built a Doctor Appointment Booking System using the MERN stack to simplify doctor-patient interactions. The system has three logins: Patient, Doctor, and Admin. Patients can book or cancel appointments, make payments, and edit profiles. Doctors can manage their schedule, view appointments, and track earnings. Admins handle doctor approvals, monitor appointments, and manage the platform. We used Tailwind CSS for styling, Axios for API calls, Cloudinary for image uploads, and Vite for fast development. The app is responsive and easy to use, especially on mobile devices.",

It helps organizations manage employee salaries, attendance, and deductions in one place. Admins can add employees, generate salary slips, and track payment history. Employees can log in to view their salary details and download payslips. We used Tailwind CSS for clean UI, MongoDB for storing records, and Vite for smooth performance. The system is secure, user-friendly, and mobile responsive.',

        description: 'Me and my team worked on a Crop Yield Prediction system for Maharashtra using machine learning. We collected and preprocessed agricultural data like rainfall, temperature, humidity, soil type, and crop types to predict crop yield for different regions. We trained and evaluated multiple ML models to get accurate predictions. Along with the model, we also created a user-friendly UI to make the system easy to use for farmers and policymakers. The project was built using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and visualization libraries, with a focus on reliability and simplicity.',

The tool allows users to input process data and visually see how algorithms like FCFS, SJF, Priority, and Round Robin schedule processes. We focused on making the UI clean and easy to use so learners can clearly understand concepts like Gantt charts, waiting time, and turnaround time. The project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with logic based on Data Structures and Algorithms.",
